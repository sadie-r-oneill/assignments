    <h1>BRULES RULES</h1>
    <h2>Check it Out!</h2>
<p>Dr. Steve Brule has been missing since August 13th, 2018,
    but has recently
     been located on a boat off the coast of 
     Amalfi, Italy. Brule claims to be looking
     for his dad who he's never met before. "Some of us
     have dads, but they're not all your dads,"says Brule.
     No one really knows how he is qualified to be called
     a doctor in the first place. Brule is known 
     for his talk show "Brules Rules," and has broken his contract
     due to his hiatus. He is being forced into rehab by Tim and Eric,
     and his show will be on hold until further notice.
