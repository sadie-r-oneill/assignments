    <span class= "brule">Steve Brule</span> has been missing since August 13th, 2018,
    but has recently
    been located on a boat off the coast of 
    Amalfi, Italy. Brule claims to be looking
    for his dad who he's never met before.

    <span class = "space2">
     "Some of us
     have dads, but they're not all your dads,"says Brule.
     No one really knows how he is qualified to be called
     a doctor in the first place. Brule is known 
     for his talk show <span class="brules-rules">"Brules Rules"</span> and has broken his contract
     due to his hiatus. He is being forced into rehab by Tim and Eric,
     and his show will be on hold until further notice.
