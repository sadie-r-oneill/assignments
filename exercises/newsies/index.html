   "Have you ever had to been in a fight? I've been in a ton of fights.
   But I'm here to teach you how to stay the heck out of a fight!" says Brule. He continues on to show his method
   called 'Playin' Possum' in which he displays an act of death, followed by a comeback to win his case! in another 
   episode Brule learns how to make paninis. He didn't know what a panini was but he learned that it was a type of 
   sandwich. He also learned about Italy in this episode, and the fact that it is shaped like a boot. "Like a cowboy
   boot," says Brule.
